/network/scratch/c/cesar.valdez/manyLatents/.venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/lightning/pytorch/trainer/connectors/logger_connector/logger_connector.py:76: Starting from v1.9.0, `tensorboardX` has been removed as a dependency of the `lightning.pytorch` package, due to potential conflicts with other packages in the ML ecosystem. For this reason, `logger=True` will use `CSVLogger` as the default logger, unless the `tensorboard` or `tensorboardX` packages are found. Please `pip install lightning[extra]` or one of them to enable TensorBoard support by default
